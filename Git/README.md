Git is a version control system, VCS, that helps software teams to track and manage changes in their code.
- ⏱ It act like a time machine, you can always come back to an earlier version.
- 🧪 It act like a testing machine, you can preview any feature without altering the stable version.
- ⚙️ It makes the work collaborative, in the context of the devops paradigm, a VCS is essential.
- 🚨 Without a VCS, a software team can run in huge problems, working concurently, without any back-up at your disposal.
