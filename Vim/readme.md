## Vim Key features 
Usually, when we type text on any app, we use the insert mode, which is really
what we are accustomed to. 

🎹 You type, and get what you typed on screen. 
It is a *one mode* system, an **Insert system**.


🥊 But Vim is different, it has **multiple modes** built in it:
   |   Mode         |    Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **👨‍🔬 Normal** | move the cursor, and type vim commands |
| ✍️ **Insert**|  move the cursor and Type words|
|  🔍 **Visual mode** | moving the cursor selects the text |


    

You can type in commands by typing " : (colon) "  while in normal mode
and perform many actions 📲 : 
- *Create files, edit files, split buffers (vim spanes/screens), search for words, etc..*@
